; Hook for "abilitySlots <N> log". Entered through a jmp written over the stock code; leaves
; through an explicit jmp to a verified continuation (docs/engine-symbols.md, "Abilities").
; abilitySlots itself is a one-dword patch (features/abilityslots.cpp) and needs no hook.

; Replaces 0x696C70 (call 45EE37h, ECX = [esp+58h]) in FUN_0046188E, the command panel refresh:
; the path taken when AbilityMgr::GetNth (call at 0x696C59) found the unit's n-th ability.
; The frame is the stock one. EDI = the unit; GetNth's out slots are [esp+0Ch] (enabled byte),
; [esp+2Ch] (record index) and [esp+78h] (power ID); [esp+34h] = n + 1 (0x696C1F). Logs the
; buttons at n >= 6, which stock never asks for, then makes the stock call: EAX, ECX, EDX and the
; flags are dead before a call, and the FPU stack is empty there, so the log runs before it.
